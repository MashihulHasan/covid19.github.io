            <h2>#FAQ(frequently Asked Questions)</h2>
            <h3>
                <li>What is Omicron and what makes it a variant of concern (VoC)?</li>
            </h3>
            <p>It is a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 that has recently been reported from South Africa on 24th November 2021
                called as B.1.1.529 or Omicron (based on Greek alphabets like alpha, beta, delta etc). This variant has
                shown a very large number of mutations, especially more than 30 on the viral spike protein, which is the
                key target of the immune response. Given the collection of mutations in Omicron, which earlier
                individually have been associated with increased infectivity and/or immune evasion, and the sudden rise
                in number of positive cases in South Africa, World Health Organization has declared Omicron as a Variant
                of Concern (VoC)
            </p><br>
            <h3>
                <li>Can the currently used diagnostics methods, detect Omicron?</li>
            </h3>
            <p> The most accepted and commonly used method of diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2 Variant is RT-PCR method. This
                method detects specific genes in the virus, such as Spike (S), Enveloped (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) etc to
                confirm the presence of virus. However, in case of Omicron, as the S gene is heavily mutated, some of
                the primers may lead to results indicating absence of the S gene (called as S gene drop out). This
                particular S gene drop out along with the detection of other viral genes could be used a diagnostic
                feature of Omicron. However, for final confirmation of the omicron variant genomic sequencing is
                required.
            </p><br>
            <h3>
                <li>How concerned should we be about the new VoC?</li>
            </h3>
            <p> WHO declares a variant as a VoC after assessment when there is increase in transmissibility or
                detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology; OR increase in virulence or change in clinical disease
                presentation; OR decrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available
                diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics. (Source: WHO).
                It is important to highlight that Omicron has been declared VoC based on the observed mutations, their
                predicted features of increased transmission and immune evasion, and preliminary evidence of detrimental
                change in COVID-19 epidemiology, such as increased reinfections. The definitive evidence for increased
                remission and immune evasion is awaited.

            <h3>
                <li>What precautions should we take?</li>
            </h3>
            <p> The precautions and steps to be taken remain same as before. It is essential to mask yourself properly,
                take both doses of vaccines (if not yet vaccinated), maintain social distancing and maintain good
                ventilation to the maximum possible.
